          Penrose is a small game project created by two friends and me. We all
          contributed to all aspects of the game but I was in charge of game
          design and art. Penrose was published to the Google Play store for
          early access and people seemed to enjoy it quite a bit.
          <a href="http://senet.studio">You can play it here!</a>

          Created all twenty levels of the game thinking carefully about the
          puzzles and difficulty curve.</p>

        <p class="blog-text">
          I tried to keep the flow to the very minimum to avoid extra work and
          helped us polish the game itself rather than build extra screens.

          Learnings:
          <ul class="blog-text">
            <li> <p>One of the biggest lessons we learned was to start small.
                Even with the simplicity of Penrose, it still took us quite a
                while to put together, and we only worked one or two days every
                month. It was a blessing for us to scope down and perfect the
                small things.
              </p></li>
            <li><p>We quickly found that some levels were much harder than
                others and dropoff was often seen at certain levels. By tuning
                the learning curve and difficulty, as well as moving around a
                few of the harder levels to the back, we were able to create a
                nice change to the learning curve.
              </p></li>
